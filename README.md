Description:
--------------
- Using HTML and CSS, I redesigned the login page, as well as the profile page of Instagram's web app.
- The redesigned login page features a more minimal and sleek design and is more appealing to the user compared the Instagram's current login page. The redesigned profile page features a vertical navigation bar that is pinned to the left-hand side of the viewport, and also features a more cleaner grid for presenting the user's posts.

Tools used:
